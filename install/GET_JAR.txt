WHERE TO GET THE PRE-COMPILED JAR FILE
================================================================================

The installation package requires the compiled JAR file:
  ai-minecraft-player-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

OPTION 1: Download from GitHub Releases (Recommended)
------------------------------------------------------

Visit: https://github.com/your-username/AI_Minecraft_Players/releases

Download the latest release which includes:
  - ai-minecraft-player-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (pre-compiled mod)
  - Installation package with configs
  - Complete documentation

Then copy the JAR to this directory:
  cp ai-minecraft-player-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar install/

OPTION 2: Build from Source
----------------------------

Requirements:
  - Java 17+
  - Gradle 8.0+
  - Proper Fabric mod development environment
  - Internet connection (first build downloads dependencies)

Steps:
  1. Ensure you have the Fabric development environment set up
  2. Run: gradle clean build
  3. JAR will be in: build/libs/ai-minecraft-player-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
  4. Copy to install directory: cp build/libs/*.jar install/

See BUILD.md for detailed build instructions and troubleshooting.

OPTION 3: Use Pre-Built Release Package
----------------------------------------

For end-users, download the complete release package that already includes
the pre-compiled JAR:

  ai-minecraft-player-install-v0.1.0.zip

This package contains everything needed:
  - Pre-compiled JAR file
  - Configuration files
  - Documentation
  - Installation scripts
