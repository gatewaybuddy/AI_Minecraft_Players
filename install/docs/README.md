## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Download the mod** (requires Minecraft 1.20.4 + Fabric)
2. **Copy to mods folder**: `cp ai-minecraft-player-*.jar server/mods/`
3. **Start server** (generates config at `server/config/aiplayer-config.json`)
4. **Configure** (see below)
5. **Restart and spawn**: `/aiplayer spawn`

### Configuration Modes

| Mode | Setup | Capabilities | Cost |
|------|-------|--------------|------|
| **INTELLIGENT** | Add API key | Goal planning, memory, learning | $0.36-0.90/hr (or FREE with Ollama) |
| **SIMPLE** | Leave apiKey empty | Random walk, basic movement | FREE |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Quick Setup: OpenAI (Intelligent Mode)

Edit `config/aiplayer-config.json`:

```json
{
  "username": "AISteve",
  "llm": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4-turbo",
    "apiKey": "sk-proj-YOUR_KEY_HERE"
  }
}
```

### Quick Setup: Local Ollama (Intelligent Mode - FREE!)

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama pull mistral
ollama serve &
```

Edit `config/aiplayer-config.json`:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "local",
    "model": "mistral"
  }
}
```

### Quick Setup: Simple Mode (FREE!)

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "apiKey": ""
  }
}
```

**No API key needed** - AI uses simple random walk behavior.

## 🎭 Personality Roles

Customize AI behavior with personality traits and activity preferences!

### Pre-made Roles

| Role | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **⛏️ Miner** | Loves digging and gathering resources | Resource farms, cave exploration |
| **🗺️ Adventurer** | Curious explorer seeking discoveries | Mapping terrain, finding structures |
| **⚔️ Aggressive Hunter** | Fearless mob hunter | Mob clearing, aggressive defense |
| **🛡️ Defensive Support** | Protective team player | Base protection, bodyguard |
| **🏗️ Builder** | Creative constructor | Building projects, farms |

### Using Presets

```bash
# Copy a role preset
cp config/roles/miner.json config/aiplayer-config.json

# Add your API key
nano config/aiplayer-config.json
```

### Custom Personalities

Customize traits (0.0 - 1.0):

```json
{
  "personality": {
    "description": "helpful explorer",
    "traits": {
      "aggression": 0.3,    // Combat tendency
      "curiosity": 0.8,     // Exploration drive
      "caution": 0.6,       // Risk aversion
      "sociability": 0.7,   // Player interaction
      "independence": 0.5   // Autonomy level
    },
    "preferences": {
      "mining": 0.5,
      "building": 0.5,
      "exploration": 0.8,
      "combat": 0.3,
      "farming": 0.4,
      "trading": 0.6
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### AI in SIMPLE mode

**Problem**: Logs show "AI players will run in SIMPLE mode"

**Solution**: Check your API key:
- OpenAI: Starts with `sk-proj-` or `sk-`
- Claude: Starts with `sk-ant-`
- Local: Check Ollama is running: `curl http://localhost:11434`

### High costs

**Problem**: LLM costs too high

**Solutions**:
1. **Use local models** (FREE): `"provider": "local", "model": "mistral"`
2. Use cheaper models: `"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"`
3. Verify caching is working (check logs)

### Ollama model not found

```bash
ollama pull mistral
ollama list
```

## 💡 Inspiration

Based on cutting-edge AI research:

- **[Voyager](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291)** - LLM-powered Minecraft agent with skill library
- **[MineDojo](https://minedojo.org/)** - Open-ended embodied agents
- **[Baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone)** - Minecraft pathfinding
- **ReAct** - Reasoning + Acting framework

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### API Key Security

- ⚠️ **NEVER commit API keys to Git**
- Use `.gitignore` for config files
- Rotate keys regularly
- Monitor usage on provider dashboards

### Server Permissions

- AI players can perform all player actions
- Consider using separate permissions/roles
- Configure `goals.acceptPlayerRequests` based on trust level

### Performance

- Each AI player: ~10-15MB RAM
- LLM calls are async (non-blocking)
- For many AIs, use local models (no rate limits)
